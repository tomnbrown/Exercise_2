Instructions on code operation
The two time integration codes should be run from the terminal in the following format:

"timeintegrator".py "outputfile".dat "inputfile".dat

where timeintegrator, outputfile, and inputfile should be replaced with the python programme you are wanting to run, the output file with any output file name, and the input file with one of the sets of initial conditions uploaded

Additionally, I have left one of the particle instances to be user defined to reduce the number of input files required. If the user wants to read data from a file they can use the same code as for particle 1, just with an added system argument.
